# :pencil: Elizium.Klassy

Deprecation :warning: This module will soon be retired as I realised I made a mistake in class implementations in client modules Loopz and PoShLog, meaning there is now no reason for being for this module. The next releases of these 2 client modules will take back their class implementations currently residing here.
